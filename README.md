# Adversarially-Robust-Sentiment-Analysis

# Introduction

  Sentiment Analysis: scoring or classifying a piece of text based on the emotions of the text.

  Applications: 
  1. Product Recommendation
  2. Social media monitoring
  3. Market research
  4. Customer service
  
  Adversarial Robustness: Are deep neural networks robust to adversarial samples?
  Adversarial sample: Strategically modified input sample that fools the model to give wrong predictions.

  Importance of adversarial robustness:
  1. Reliability
  2. Generalizability

  Goal: 
  1. Learn adversarially robust deep neural networks for sentiment analysis.
  2. Generate adversarial samples to attack the model.
  3. Use generated adversarial samples with natural samples to train the model for adversarial robustness.
  4. Use the learned model to correctly predict both natural and adversarial samples.
